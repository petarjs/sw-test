# Solidity Workshop Nis

We are going to create a decentralized platform for asking and answering questions.

## Required softweare

To follow this guide you'll need to install the following:

- NodeJS & npm
- Truffle
- Metamask

## Creating the project

Create the directory where your project will live, and then initialize the project using Truffle:

```sh
mkdir solidity-workshop
cd solidity-workshop
truffle init
```

After that, you'll see that Truffle generated a bunch of files and folders, that we'll use to develop the project.

## Configuring the project

We need to configure the project to tell Truffle how to connect to the blockchain. While developing, we'll use Truffle's built in Ethereum blockchain simulation. To deploy your contracts to a testnet or the mainnet later, just add the required configuration entries.

The configuration for UNIX based systems is held in `truffle.js`, and for Windows please use `truffle-config.js`.

Add this to your configuration file:

```js
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 9545,
      network_id: "*"
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating the contract

Now, in your `contracts` directory, create a file named `Dask.sol`. Here we'll write our code.

## Compiling

To compile your solidity contracts, use this command:

```sh
truffle compile
```

## Migrations

Migrations are files that define how your contracts will be deployed to blockchain. They live in the `migrations` folder. You can just copy-paste the already provided `1_initial_migration.js` and change the code to match your contract's name.

To migrate your contracts to the blockchain, there are several prerequisites:

1. You compiled your contracts.
2. You have the blockchain defined in the `truffle.js` running.

To start Truffle's test blockchain, just run:

```sh
truffle develop
```

This command needs to continue running for as long you're developing, so it's best to run it in a new terminal window.

Now that we have the test blockchain running, we can migrate the contracts by executing:

```sh
truffle migrate
```

This command uses the development config from `truffle.js`. If you want to migrate to a different network, you can specify that using the `--network` argument (e.g. `truffle migrate --network ropsten`).

## Interact with the blockchain

When you ran `truffle develop`, it generated some acconuts for you, and preloaded them with some ether, so you don't need to worry about that. Ether is required for sending transactions and calling smart contract methods that modify the contract's state.

Inside the console, you can query and modify the blockchain state by using the `web3` object. For example, to find out how many weis there are in one ether, run:

```js
web3.toWei(1, 'ether')
```

All the accounts that Truffle generated for us are stored in `web3.eth.accounts`. For example, to find out how much ether the first account has, run:

```js
web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0])
```

## Transfering ether

Let's say we wanted to transfer 2 ether from the first to the second account. First, let's find out how much ether each has.

```js
web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0])
web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[1])
```

We see that they each have 1000000 ether.

To make the transaction, we'll use the `web3.eth.sendTransaction` method.

```js
web3.eth.sendTransaction({
    from: web3.eth.accounts[0],
    to: web3.eth.accounts[1],
    value: web3.toWei(2, 'ether')
})
```

Now if we check how much each account has, we'll see it changed.

## Calling methods on our smart contract

First, we need to obtain a reference to our deployed contract. We do that by executing:

```js
let dask
Dask.deployed().then(d => dask = d)
```

After that, we'll have the contract in `dask` variable, and will be able to interact with it. For example, we might want to know the price per answer:

```js
dask.getPricePerAnswer()
```

## Interacting with our smart contract from JavaScript

To interact with the blockchain from our webpage, we'll use the `web3` library. Instead of importing the lib ourselves, we'll install the Metamask Chrome extension which will inject the `web3` object into our webpage. By doing this we can call methods on the blockchain, like transfering ether and getting address balances.

But to interact with our smart contract, we need to let `web3` know how to talk to it. We do this by providing an ABI of our smart contract to `web3`. ABI (application binary interface) is simply a JSON representation of our smart contract's interface (a list of methods, arguments, types...). To see how an ABI looks, we can look into our `build/contracts/` folder. If we open `Dask.json`, among other properties, we'll see the `abi` property. We want to copy this and paste it into our webpage.

The second thing we need is the address to which our smart contract is deployed on the blockchain. We can get this by typing the following into the `truffle develop` console:

```js
Dask.deployed()
```

In the output you'll see an `address` property. Copy this too and paste into the webpage.

Now, it's finally time to instantiate our contract and be able to call its methods from JavaScript. We do this by:

```js
let daskContract = web3.eth.contract(abi).at(address)
```
